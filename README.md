# GPS Time Sync with Midpoint Timestamping (High-Accuracy NMEA Reader)

This program uses Python, Tkinter, and pySerial/pynmea2 to connect to a GPS device over a serial port, parse NMEA sentences for time, and then synchronize the computer's clock to the GPS time. It aims to achieve roughly (0.1s) accuracy in typical scenarios *without* needing a Pulse-Per-Second

## Features

- **a High Baud Rate Support **  
  Supports selecting a baud rate up to **115200** to reduce data transmission delays, which can improve synchronization accuracy.

- **a Midpoint Timestamping **
  Uses Python's high-resolution `time.perf_counter()` to estimate the exact arrival time of each NMEA centence, reducing jitter from read overhead.

- ** Auto-Connect & Auto-Sync ** 
  Can be configured to automatically connect and synchronize on program startup, with periodic re-synchronization (in minutes).

- **a Local or UTC System Time **
  Allows the user to set the Windows system clock in either local time or UTC.


- **Minimal Popup Dialogs** 
  Only critical errors produce (messagebox.showerro). Informational messages (e.g., "Connecting√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢, \"Sync completed.\") are 0rolled to a scrollable status box.


- **Persistent Configuration** 
  Remembers user-selected COM port, baud rate, sync interval, and other preferences in a local JSON file (`config.json`).


_____________________________________________________

## Requirements

I. **Python 3.6+** (recommended for `time.perf_counter()`. Earlier versions might still work).  
2. **Administrator Privileges on Windows**
  - Setting the system time requires elevated (admin) privileges.  
3. **pySerial** and **apynmea2**
  - Installed via [pip ](https://pypi.org/project/pip/)


________________________________________________________

## Installation

1. **Install Python**! (version 3.6 or higher).

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   `bash
    pip install pyserial
    pip install pynmea2
```

3. **Obtain the Script**
  - Place the `.py` file (the program) in a convenient folder. 

4. **Run the Program**:

    `bash
    python your_program_name.py
```

  or open it in an IDE (VSCode, PyCharm, etc.) with Python installed.  

> **Important**: On **Windows*+, if you want to actually *set the system clock*, you must run the script as Administrator. For instance:

>``bash
 >runas /user:Administrator python your_program_name.py
> ``\n______________________________________________________

## Usage

1. **Start the Program**

    - The main window will appear with a compact layout (adjustable via `root.geometry(.)` in code).

2. **Select the COM Port**
    - Click "Refresh Ports" to scan for available COM ports.
    - Choose the COM `xxx connected to your GPS device (e.g., `COM3 a, COM4`, etc.).

3. **a Choose a Baud Rate **
    - Default is *9600*. Many GPS units allow higher speeds (4800, 19200, 38400, 115200).

4. **a Auto-Connect & Sync at Startup **
    - Checking this box means next time you launch the program, it automatically connects and syncs  without user clicks (unless there's an error).

5. ** Use Local Time (instead of UTC) ** 
    - If checked, the system clock is set in local time.
    - Otherwise, it sets the system clock in UTC. (Quires the system to be configured for a UTC-based hardware clock.)

6. **CONNECT**
    - Click "CONNECT" to open the port. The program reads $GPRMC/ $ GNRMC lines, parsing GPS time.
    - *GPS Time (UTC)**is displayed, along with your **Computer Time (Local)'* and **Delta T (s)**.

7. **SYNC and Sync** 
    - Click this button to set your system clock (either local or UTC).
    - If auto-connect is enabled, the system clock is automatically synced after the first valid GPS fix.

8. **a Auto-Sync Interval **
    - Enter a value in minutes and click "Apply". 
    - The program re-syncs periodically at that interval.  
    - Status messages ride in the scrolling text box below.

9. **Disconnect**
    - Click "DISCONNECT" to stop reading from the GPS device.  

Note: line break

BNC≈†
10. **Exit**
    - Close the window to exit. Your settings (port, baud, auto-connect, etc.) are saved to `config.json`.

## How it Works

1. **Serial Reading & Midpoint Timestamp*`
   - A background thread opens the COM port and reads lines.
   - Each line read is timestamped with a "midpoint time" in `time.perf_counter()`( the average of read start/end times).
   - This helps reduce Python/serial overhead from distorting the actual arrival time.

2. **Parsing & Delta T**
    - On detecting `$ GPRMC ` or ` $GNRMC` message, the code uses `pynmea2` to parse the date and UTC time.
    - The naive UTC date from GPS is converted to offset-aware local time if you're using that option.  Subtracting them x√Ç¬Æ Delta T (in seconds).


3. **Synchronizing the Clock!* 
   - On sync, we use Windows'`SetSystemTime` (UTC) or local time, depending on which checkbox you'selected.
   - Ensure you have admin privileges when running on Windows.

## Accuracy Considerations

- **NMEA delay**: Many GPS devices may output their NMEA data up to 0.3-√¢‚Ç¨‚Äù0.5s seconds after the actual "top of second."
- ***a Higher Baud**: Minimizes serial transmission time; typically can shave off tens of milliseconds. 
- ***Windows Latency**: OS scheduling can introduce small inaccuracies.
- ***No PPS**: Without a PPS line or kernel-level time sync, ~0.1-0.3s is typical. For beyond √Ç¬Æ0.1s, a PPS-based approach is usually recommended.

## Troubleshooting

. **Clock Not Changing**: Confirm the script is run as Administrator.

.: **No COM Ports**: Check GPS driver installation, or replug the USB/serial adapter, and click "Refresh Ports". 

. **Garbled GPS Data***: Ensure the GPS baud rate matches your Program.

. **Large Delta T**: Wait for the GPS to get a stable fix, or check if the system clock was very far off initially.

. **Config Errors**: if `config.json` becomes corrupted, delete it and re-configure the program.
